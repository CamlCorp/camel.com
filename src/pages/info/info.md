#### CAMEL
CAMEL is a design and research practice. The practice embeds buildings, drawings, environments, objects, and software with critical beauty, use, and subjectivity. 

CAMEL utilizes the archives of architecture, design, and materials, borrowing frameworks and tools from disciplines such as anthropology, geography, and ecology to uncover lost and often forgotten cultural matters of importance. These findings are then used to inform proposals and speculations in the form of design-research projects. CAMEL produces design "solutions" for issues and problems that never asked to be solved. 

Through its practice, CAMEL carries on the traditions of art (architecture & design), scholarship, and wisdom found across the Islamic regions of Central Asia and beyond.
