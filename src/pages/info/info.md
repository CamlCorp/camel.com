CAMEL is a design and research practice that embeds buildings, drawings, objects, and software with culture. CAMEL utilizes the archives of architecture and design to uncover lost and often forgotten cultural matters of importance. These findings are then used to inform proposals and speculations in the form of design-research projects, a process it calls *archi(ve)tecture*. With ancestral roots in Afghanistan, CAMEL carries on the traditions of architecture, design, and wisdom found across the Islamic regions of Central Asia.
