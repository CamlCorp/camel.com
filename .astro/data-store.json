I'm Omar Mohammad, a designer based in Kabul, Afghanistan. While studying Design at Kabul University, the reality that our country lacks a contemporary cultural design language in many fields, especially architecture and graphic design, was a constant constraint in my work and research. My main focus as a student and now as a professional is about contributing to the cultural design language of Afghanistan through personal and commercial work.*\n\n![خوش آمديد Welcome. Film still](../../../images/work/bamyan/1.png)\n\n*My MFA thesis at university explored concepts surrounding the definition of Afghan design, the artifacts of Afghan design, and the history of Afghan design. Luckily the Ministry of Information & Culture was invited to the graduate exhibition show and took great notice of my work and research. The Ministry is currently searching for fresh thinkers and designers to contribute to government funded design projects. With the sudden western boom of tourism coming to the country, many of these projects are geared towards boosting the cultural tourism economy of Afghanistan.*\n\n![Glyphs over a field. Film still](../../../images/work/bamyan/2.png)\n\n*The Buddhas of Bamyan have been a mainstay for those in the academic fields of archaeology, religion, and anthropology, yet they have not been fully utilized as a means for drawing foreigners and tourists into the country. Some of my thesis work explored graphic and visual identities in regards to this beautiful region, activating forms in the valley and landscape into cultural pieces of graphic/visual output. The Minister of Information and Culture, Ibrahim Nevin, took notice of this work and commissioned me to design a project about Bamyan that incorporated the work from my thesis. A cartoonist and filmmaker himself, Minister Nevin requested the final artifact to be a short film highlighting the beauty and wonders of the Bamyan Valley and its Buddhas.*\n\n*The film includes original music, custom graphics and typography, and a personalized voiceover. I'd like to thank my classmates, colleagues, and professors at Kabul University for their support throughout this project. It's not much, but it's a first step towards creating a cultural design language for Afghanistan.*\n\n**_- عمر محمد Omar Mohammad_**\n\n---\n` `\n\n### Unrealized Archive 7: Text To Image, Seoul, South Korea\n\nIn May of 2023, the Bamyan typeface was exhibited in Seoul for [Unrealized Archive 7: Text to Image](https://unrealizedarchive.com/text-to-image/omar-mohammad/), a project by Chris Hamamoto & Jon Sueda exploring speculative and “unrealized” design through systematic conceptual approaches.\n\nUnrealized Archive uncovers “unrealized” graphic design projects that consumed many hours—sometimes years—of work, but were never produced.

I think there is a beauty in both of these versions, but there is a poetic and abstracted gesture in the Farsi translation.

This period of time spans from the birth of my maternal grandfather Abdul Qadir Simab in Kabul of 1923, to my mother’s final departure in 1981. My father immigrated alone, while my paternal grandparents remained in the north of the country, Imam Sahib, Kunduz province, until they passed away. The reason for both of my parents’ departures was due to the unrest caused by the interventions of the Soviet Union into what had become a communist Afghan state. My mother’s family has never returned home.\n\nThe Afghanistan my family knows, remembers, and lives by is an Afghanistan frozen in a moment of time. Although frozen in the past, this era (-1981) speaks more to a future vision of the country than as it exists today. It is this sorrow for the homeland, the guilt of leaving, and the shame of what has become that drives Afghans in diaspora to either forget the good that was, or to keep warming up that frozen Afghanistan floating in the timeline. \n\nThere have been and are many ways to thaw the frozen Afghanistan; some will set on the long road of bureaucracy and politics, hoping that government intervention (national or abroad) can solve pertinent issues. Other’s will take the academic route, studying and writing about Afghan history, from the “Great Game” of the British forces in the 19th century, to the Soviet invasion, then next to the Civil War of the 90s, then onwards to a post 9/11 landscape...the list goes on. Many have found fortune in this business, Afghans and Westerners alike, but the time for trauma-informed work revolving around war, politics, and tragedy must come to an end.  \n\n### Afghanistan & New Media\nA totally new lens is required to examine Afghanistan with, one outside the scopes of business, law, engineering, and government, but one that is deeply rooted in the arts, social sciences, and culture. I have been developing this type of work through speculative design and software projects[^1], and most recently have begun research in the field of indigenous and vernacular Afghan architecture, uprooting traditional crafts to explore contemporary applications.[^2] I am not arguing that design and architecture could have “saved” Afghanistan, but I do believe that its lack of presence, gravitas, and existence within the fabric of the society for such a long time has caused ruptures that are hard to repair let alone heal. [^3] \n\nHowever, there is a discipline which brings together multiple facets of design, urban studies, technology, architecture, anthropology, and geography, that when combined form a new epistemological approach to thinking about and understanding the country. I argue that the discipline of new media can enable artists, designers, and researchers of all backgrounds to uncover hidden realities of Afghanistan, its past, its present, and its future. I will be doing this work by engaging with the transportation system of the rail as a mode of new media; a networked communication device possessing nodes embedded within cities and links within the countryside capable of uniting a mass of peoples under a unifying, cosmopolitan, diverse identity. \n\nIn late 2021, I was conducting research for a design project titled [Marcaz مرکز](https://marcaz.org/), an online platform for new conversations about visual and digital culture from in and around Afghanistan and its diaspora.[^4] Sifting through newfound archives across the internet, I came across old newspapers from the 1920’s-1980s in Afghanistan. I was mostly interested in the Farsi typography and graphic design of logos and newspaper headlines, but in the process I would come across interesting articles and pieces of news. There was one article that shared not much value in design, yet possessed a headline that seared itself into my mind. On page 5 of the *Afghanistan Council Newsletter, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Fall 1976)* [^5], in the top right corner, a medium sized heading reads, “Afghanistan to have railway network by 1983”.\n\n### An Afghan railroad?\n![\"Afghanistan Council Newsletter, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Fall 1976)\"](../../../images/work/millie/1983.jpg)\n\nThe article reads to say that Iran has agreed to fund a railway line that will finally connect Afghanistan to Europe, “providing vital access to the outside world”. [^6] There is no description of how this new rail will influence communications, travel, or any reference to the rails being designated as passenger specific; its main reasons for support are trade, detailed by the possibility of a freight train to a major iron ore deposit northwest of Kabul.\n\nThe route for this proposal is mentioned to run west from the border of Iran to Herat, from Herat southeast to Kandahar, and from Kandahar north to Kabul. Again, no mention of the connecting of cities/villages/provinces in between. As with any state or province, the major city is the main source of culture, education, happenings, and transportation (airports and train stations etc.). Kabul and Afghanistan is no different. As an ancestral anecdote, my mother’s family is from Kabul, and my mother will often joke with my father about how he is from the northern “countryside” where they lacked certain first-class education and culture. On the contrary, my father is proud to be from the countryside and rejects the urban chaos and pretentiousness that exists in Kabul. \n\nAll jokes aside, this major difference in culture between Kabul and Kunduz is separated by roughly 300km/200mi, a distance here in the West that takes about 3 hours to drive in prime conditions. Afghanistan is roughly the size of Texas, yet its beauty lies in the major cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity that exists within a border that small. How would the fabric of Afghan society have formed itself had a distance that small been connected by a communication network of rail during the formative moments of global modernism? A connection of people and ideas scattered throughout the country, within the framework of something as simple as a train, has the potential for something great to happen within the history of Afghanistan. I cannot build and implement the first Afghan passenger train railway, but I can design one through a speculative fashion. \n\n![The original source of research I came across that inspired this network was a drawing of the paved and unpaved roads by architect Rafi Samizay. \"Rafi Samizay, Urban Growth and Residential Prototypes in Kabul, Afghanistan by M. Rafi Samizay (MIT, 1974), 13.\"](../../../images/work/millie/2.jpg)\n\n### Cinema & The Train\nA new media city, for me, is one that is connected by means of analog and digital communication networks. These networks range from physical transportation systems such as the railway and interconnected highways, to the analog/digital hybrid of radio communication, and to the often invisible but physically embedded internet infrastructure. What all of these networks have in common is the shared responsibility to transport information from one location in space and time to another. People, cultures, ideas, languages, maps, religions, tales; information not in the numerical sense, but in an anthropological one.\n\nOvertime the network gradually transforms from one that is tangible and visible to one that exists primarily within our machines and mobile screens. In *The Language of New Media*, Lev Manovich introduces his readers to his concept of new media within the framework of five principles for new media:\n\n1 - Numerical Representation\n\\\n2 - Modularity\n\\\n3 - Automation\n\\\n4 - Variability\n\\\n5 - Transcoding\n\nHe goes on to introduce *cinema* as an older form of media with which all five principles still apply to.[^7] Using Manovich’s cinema as a primary framework to wrap the origins of new media around, Nanna Verhoeff in *Mobile Screens-The Visual Regime of Navigation* introduces the train as the cinema’s analog counterpart. Verhoeff introduces her reader to the 2010 exhibition by the EYE Film Institute Netherlands titled *Zoomscape*, an exhibition about film, trains and perception. [^8] The curator of the exhibition writes:\n\n*Trains and films go hand-in-hand. When the first trains chugged up to speed around 1835 they changed the way we experience reality. The world became a moving image, the carriage windows an imaginary film screen which new horizons passed by on.*[^9]\n\n![Millie Rail logo superimposed on ruins of a Kabul-Darulaman tramway train; the first and only passenger rail to be built in Afghanistan. See more: https://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/afghanistan/steam-locomotives-at-the-national-museum-of-afghanistan/#fn-5233-2](../../../images/work/millie/3.jpg)\n\nBoth Manovich and Verhoeff utilize the cinema and the train, respectively, as a precursor and definitive moment of the way humans engage with information through space, time, and environment. The window of the train allowed for scenes of reality that are impossible to experience otherwise, a feat that the film camera engineered in its own right. The processing and transferring of data from the movie screen and the train window to the viewer, however, rarely happens in isolation. The edifice of the actual cinema/theatre, with its rows of seats and close proximity, and the train car with its own set of seats and often times extreme close proximity, sometimes through standing, is a physical, social network in itself. A timed social network, in the case of a film a matter of hours, or in the case of the train, sometimes hours, a day, or even more, humans are contained within a shared space emitting personal feedback amidst an experience of absorbing feedback produced by those in shared space. New media is a media that *cannot* happen in isolation. Interactivity between machines and networks, humans and machines, networks and humans, and humans and humans produce the side effect of what makes new media, “new”. \n\n### Amanullah Khan’s modernist visions\nUnder King Zahir Shah from 1933-1973, Afghanistan as a nation reached a state of peace that some may argue was the “golden age” of the country. Modernization moved slowly, which pleased the city dwellers with its progress for progress’ sake, yet this rate also pleased those living in the country side, the “traditionalists” who were cautious about the rapid globalization and modernization of the country.[^10] The culture of major cities including Kabul (the strongest influence), Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, and Kandahar grew alongside the new media that was being introduced gradually: radio, cinema, television, and buses. However, this introduction of new media did not have the same affect on those outside of the major cities, partly because those areas were rarely introduced to new media communication technology to begin with.\n\nVillages and towns on the periphery were treated as second class subjects. This divide between city and rural social and cultural life began during the reign of the previous king Amanullah Khan who ruled from 1919 to 1929. Amanullah was the first Afghan leader to attempt a sudden and forceful “modernization” of the country. After a famed visit across much of Europe in 1928, with an emphasis on Britain, France, and Germany, Amanullah returned with a plan to bring his country out of the dark ages to the western light.[^11] A prime example of this was the unveiling of his wife, Queen Soraya Tarzi, in public. Muslim women at this time in Afghanistan practiced the veil, or *چادر chadar*, in most public settings. Even in the cities, the veil was practiced, but when Queen Soraya returned from her European voyage, the veil was removed, and even attempted to ban.\n\nI use the case of the veil to tell the story of the nuances between culture within Afghanistan in the early 20th century. The cities, Kabul especially, applied Amanullah’s modernization efforts rapidly, however those in the villages throughout the country saw Amanullah’s modernist reform as a threat to their conservative culture. Eventually a former soldier by the name of Habibullah Kalakani organized an uprising against Amanullah and his western ideals and eventually drove him out of the country. Kalakani’s traditional rule ended within the year however, and Mohammad Nadir Shah, and soon son Zahir Shah, ruled as kings for the next 50 plus years, abolishing Amanullahs hasty reforms, yet still applying modernization efforts at a slower, more acceptable rate. \n\nI bring up this bit of history to illustrate the dynamics at play between city folks, the elite, and the educated, versus the rural folk, the tribal and the nomads, or the ones living “off the grid” as we would call it now. To this day, Afghanistan exists in such a way, which makes a unifying national and cultural identity such a challenge. Each ethnic group shares and develops a subculture of their own, dependent on their tribal cultures. This is highly reflected in the language, music, and architecture of different regions within Afghanistan.\n\nBut what if Amanullah’s intentions were not full of malice, but only his concept of modernization was incorrect? Rather than take his own people’s culture into consideration, he made a rash decision to become more like the west. Although problematic in a homogenized/globalized sense, the west *has* been able to create successful nation states that share a unified culture and DNA, even amongst those diverse populations that live within them. I argue that new media is the device that has allowed western societies to create this unified identity. And in the case of Afghanistan, I argue that it was the *lack* of a national rail system, what I would define as the origin of new media through the combined lens’ of Manovich and Verhoeff, that has led to a constant division between a people of the same land.\n\n![حلقه Halkah/ring graphic; the shape that is the unifying essence of the Afghanistan National Rail.](../../../images/work/millie/4.jpg)\n\n### The Train, The Bus, and their Passengers\nSince the end of the 19th century the surrounding countries of Afghanistan: Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan (then India) all had some sort of rail lines constructed, freight or passenger. At this time, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were under Soviet government control, and the region of Pakistan (India) was under colonial British rule. Many lines were built reaching the Afghan border, and many proposals were forwarded to the government by both the Soviets and the British, and other European states. During this time the Emir Abdurrahman Khan, grandfather of modernist reformer Amanullah Khan, was placed in the middle of the “Great Game”; a Cold War type battle for Afghanistan by Russian and British colonial forces. In order to protect his country from foreign interest, Abdurrahman wanted to keep his country as isolated as possible, free of a rail that could be utilized by invading forces.[^12]\n\n![Still of Millie Bus from \"Talangar Show About Kabul Bus's 09th February 2015\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDlEFFVoJbg](../../../images/work/millie/5.jpg)\n\nThis keyword of *isolation* is the exact issue at hand. Fast forward to 1994 and the end of the Afghan civil war post-Soviet withdrawal; the Taliban came out on top and immediately banned the internet to keep the country isolated from outside influence. 1994! This was the *exact time* to *get* on the internet. From 1994-2001 Afghanistan lacked internet network infrastructure. At a time so pivotal to the global development of individuals and societies on both the micro and macro scale, Afghanistan’s communication infrastructure was again left in the dark. The lack of a rail line in the name of “preservation” of country carried on by Abdurrahman, I believe, has had the same exact effect on the country as the internet ban by the Taliban has had. It is not that Afghanistan has remained “backwards”; there is a thriving economy, development, and infrastructural work happening at an exponential rate, but it has yet to have the opportunity to jump into the future on its own terms as a democratic, united people.[^13]\n\nFocusing shortly on Kabul as a new media city within the context of Afghanistan, we will look at how the implementation of public transportation led to a successful “modern” city, where folks of all backgrounds were unified under the “كابلى Kabuli” identity. To be كابلى Kabuli was to identify as city-folk. Understanding levels of inner-city privilege, to be an upper-class كابلى Kabuli meant to attend school, go to university, work in an office, watch movies at the cinema, and take the bus. One could dress how they want and do what they want. When in such a crowded environment, the individual blends in no matter their irregularities; this cosmopolitan energy led to the success of my family’s generation in Kabul. \n\nOn the public bus one would find a religious elder clad in turban and traditional clothing, a youth wearing western clothes, a woman with her hair flowing, and a veiled mother  carrying her baby; it is an extremely beautiful image to see. In the short film titled آرزو The Wish (date unknown), a film by همایون مروت Homayun Morowat, the viewer is carried through a city montage of Kabul through a narrative told from the first person perspective of the bus itself.\n\n\u003Ciframe \n  width=\"auto\" \n  height=\"367\" \n  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LUCz7XIQgmE\" \n  title=\"YouTube video player\" \n  frameborder=\"0\" \n  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \n  allowfullscreen\n/>\n\\\nThe bus is anthropomorphized and tells the tales of the many different riders he knows and cares for, and how his job is to take care of the different people of Kabul by providing them this transportation service. It is a beautiful film that brought me to tears. Below are stills:   \n\n![4:00 \"آرزو The Wish\": Woman in چادر chadar carrying babies](../../../images/work/millie/crowds_1.jpg)\n\n![4:23 \"آرزو The Wish\": Men and women in varying attire crowded on the bus](../../../images/work/millie/crowds_2.jpg)\n\n![4:40 \"آرزو The Wish\": Crowds waiting for the bus](../../../images/work/millie/crowds_3.jpg)\n\nIn *Charles Baudelaire: A Lyric Poet in the Era of High Capitalism*, Walter Benjamin writes about the flaneur’s relationship to the city, forming the city as the true existence of the flaneur, without which the flaneur ceases to exist. On the topic of how an individual who may not identify as a flaneur must adapt themselves to the peculiarities of a city, Benjamin quotes sociologist Georg Simmel:\n\n'Someone who sees without hearing is much more uneasy than someone who hears without seeing. In this there is something characteristic of the sociology of the big city. Interpersonal relationships in big cities are distinguished by a marked preponderance of the activity of the eye over the activity of the ear. *The main reason for this is the public means of transportation*. Before the development of buses, railroads, and trams in the nineteenth century, people had never been in a position of having to look at one another for long minutes or even hours without speaking to one another.’[^15]\n\nIt is by the quick and simple visual sense of sight that humans can come to know one another, either through judgment, or inquiry, or even curiosity. But it is at this moment that Benjamin and Simmel are stating that *something happens* when humans are forced within the confines of the bus or the train, forced to exist in a confined space with one who is *nothing* like you, or even yet, nothing *to* you. Forced to enter or exit at the same spot, sit next to one another, or by God’s good grace even speak to one another, perhaps an understanding can be made. A sacred covenant between the the local Kabuli city dweller, and the worker visiting temporarily from the country side in Kunduz, can be made in those tense, stressful moments of forced co-existence. As the two part ways, the Kunduzi exists within the Kabuli, and the Kabuli exists within the Kunduzi. Who knows who else they may share that essence with?\n\nKabul as a new media city proves successful between the time span post Habibullah Kalakani’s takeover (1929) until the soviet invasion (1979). These 50 years saw major progress within Kabul, as my mother, grandparents, uncles, and aunts testify to. Sadly I do not have the resources or the scope to investigate what was occurring within the other major cities, such as Herat or Mazar-e-Sharif, but I was able to ask my father, Said Mohammad, about how things were going on in the north in Imam Sahib, Kunduz. He mentioned that there weren’t many buses, but there *were* horse-drawn carriages...My mother’s point proven I suppose!\n\nThe bus system in Kabul was a public bus system owned by the government called ملى بس Millie Bus, or National Bus; ملى millie means national in Farsi.[^16] Although named “National”, it only stayed within city limits. The bus was my family’s main method of transport in Kabul from its origins until they left in 1981. By the end of the soviet invasion and the civil war, Millie Bus’ infrastructure was completely destroyed. Today Millie Bus is gaining government attention and funding once more; the infrastructure was never able to recover after so many years of destruction, but the process is ongoing.[^17] \n\n![Stills of Millie Bus logos from \"Talangar Show About Kabul Bus's 09th February 2015\" & \"آرزو The Wish\" film by Homayun Morowat. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDlEFFVoJbg & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUCz7XIQgmE](../../../images/work/millie/6.jpg)\n\n--- \n` `\n## A Fictional History, a Speculative Future (Part II)\nUtilizing the framework of the Millie Bus, a device used to unify a people and create a network of information transfer between them within the new media city of Kabul, I propose the ملى قطار Millie Rail (National Rail). ملى قطار Millie Rail will be utilized as a device to unify the entire people of Afghanistan and create a network of information transfer between them within the new media *nation* of Afghanistan.\n\n### ملى قطار Millie Rail\n\n![Speculative Afghanistan National Rail Map (Farsi)](../../../images/work/millie/farsi.jpg)\n\nHad a national passenger railway in Afghanistan been designed and implemented in the early 20th century, perhaps the Afghanistan of today would have ended up a little different. I am speculating, a pure and perhaps naive speculation, that through an experience of clashing cultures and ideologies accelerated by rail travel, the constant division the country has experienced since 1929, then 1979, then 1994, then 2001, then 2021, may have never occurred. Instead of this division, a unity umbrellaed by a network of the capital, major cities, towns, and villages had a potential to exist. \n\nIn order to demonstrate this concept within the constraints of this work, I will be using digital media, graphic design, and sketches to communicate a speculative vision for the Afghan national rail. The purpose of this is to create a fictional history through speculative means where the spirit of the idea of the train exists. Through image-making, I am hoping to provoke perceptions and realities of the history of Afghanistan, while using prior cultural context to inform a speculative reality. I will do this by designing actual artifacts, and writing supplemental text to give context to design decisions, concepts, and potential outcomes.\n\n### Naming\nTo name something is to give it existence. The names of our public institutions become significant to the cultural identification of our locations. In the Bay Area, we have *Bay Area Rapid Transit*, our geo-specific train transit. Nation wide, the passenger rail in the USA is called *Amtrak*, a portmanteau of the words “America” and “track”. For Afghanistan, the closest resemblance to an institution as such is the ملى بس Millie Bus, as discussed previously. This name carries a sense of nostalgia for my family and relatives who lived in Kabul. When asking my grandmother, Sharifa Simab, what the bus system was called, I could see her eyes light up with a whole vision of her past. Asking simply for the name of the bus, she began to recall the name of the streets, the certain bus stops she would take, the times she would need to make it on time. My mother, Fariha Mohammad, who sat close by chimed in on how “cute” the young men who drove the buses were, noting how she and her girlfriends would take the same bus everyday to match with their favorite driver. The bus, for my teenage mother, became a form of a social network, meeting her friends, crushing on boys, and it was with the simple memory of the name that these memories came flowing back. At a much larger scale, could a railway have done the same thing?\n\nUsing ملى بس Millie Bus as the framework for much of this work, it feels natural to evolve from the bus to the train with ملى قطار Millie Rail. Here بس in Farsi transliterates to “bus”, where the word for bus is shared between Farsi/English. In the case of the train, قطار transliterates to “qataar”, a word meaning train/rail[^18] in Farsi, borrowed from Arabic which means a “row of camels” and “train”. [^19]. ملى قطار Millie Rail is to be used as a familiar device for those accustomed to the ملى بس Millie Bus institution. \n\n![Redrawn and reimagined bus and rail logos](../../../images/work/millie/graphic-logos.jpg)\n\n### Logo\nAs with naming, the logo carries on the existence and soul of the institution it represents. For Bay Area natives, the BART logo represents home, and has been reconceptualized, remixed, and recycled as clothing logos, album art, stickers, etc. The BART logo has become culture itself. In my research of Afghan graphic design, I have been unsuccessful in uncovering graphic designers of the modern era and their works. I have just recently come across architectural references, but am having no luck with graphic design. I hope to come across this work soon. \n\n![Still from \"آرزو The Wish\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUCz7XIQgmE](../../../images/work/millie/logo_1.jpg)\n\n![Still from \"Talangar Show About Kabul Bus's\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDlEFFVoJbg](../../../images/work/millie/logo_2.jpg)\n\n![Still from \"Talangar Show About Kabul Bus's\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDlEFFVoJbg](../../../images/work/millie/logo_3.jpg)\n\n![Still from \"Talangar Show About Kabul Bus's\". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDlEFFVoJbg](../../../images/work/millie/logo_4.jpg)\n\nThe ملى بس Millie Bus logo surfaced itself in the آرزو The Wish documentary. A YouTube channel called “تلنگر Talangar”, created a documentary on the crumbling Millie Bus infrastructure ten years ago, and it is through this video that I have surfaced higher-resolution images of the ملى بس Millie Bus. The images above show the old logo in tact (at low resolution), and eventually an image that shows the lack of importance paid to the application, one stenciled with spray paint and the other decaying. There is no standard guideline for how to design the word mark, but the framework is there:\n\n1: A circle frame that locks up the logo\n\\\n2: A center horizontal band in yellow that reads the English “Millie-Bus” in black is constant on white backgrounds\n\\\n3: The top portion reads ملىى Millie, where the last letter “ى” is stylized in a manner to shape the “tail” upwards into a quarter circle shape\n\\\n4: The bottom portion reads بس Bus, where the last letter “س” is stylized in a manner to shape the “tail” downwards into a quarter circle shape\n\nIt appears that there is no standardization to the execution in the examples I have sourced, however following those guidelines seems to get the job done. I will be executing the ملى قطار Millie Rail logo in similar fashion. \n\nThe following are a set of speculative logos I designed based on the found material above demonstrating a shared identity between the Millie Bus and Millie Rail institutions. \n\n![ملى بس Millie Bus logo](../../../images/work/millie/bus.jpg)\n\n![ملى قطار Millie Rail logo](../../../images/work/millie/rail.jpg)\n\nThe Millie Bus logo is replicated nearly 1:1 as it is found from the visual research I conducted, and the Millie Rail logo borrows similar visual relationships, with a custom drawn قطار lettering.\n\n![Custom drawn wordmarks](../../../images/work/millie/wordmarks.jpg)\n\n### Map\nAs with the BART logo, the BART map unifies the Bay Area within a particular region. The BART map can be utilized to define and mark where the cultural bounds of Bay Area culture begins and ends, along with demarcating the limits of subcultures regarding the multiple regions: East Bay, San Francisco, Oakland, Peninsula, San Jose.   \n\n![BART Map](../../../images/work/millie/bart.jpg)\n\nAlthough subcultures, ideologies, economics, and politics may differ between the inner East Bay the end of the Richmond line, the BART map creates an interconnectedness between riders. As an analog New Media device embodied within the city, all maps depicting such information create a new type of networked topology with which an individual can come to ontological definitions about themselves and others within their shared environment. Working with Afghanistan’s smaller scale, we can transpose the networked rail map from the city, to the region, and ultimately to the nation. The map here will act as the most critical of artifacts to speculate on the side-effects of the existence of the ملى قطار Millie Rail.\n\n![Samizay’s map acted as the framework for the ring rail. An abstracted form of an ellipse connects all major cities surrounding the ring rail.](../../../images/work/millie/map-research.jpg)\n\nThe following is a speculative ملى قطار Millie Rail map I designed based on a multitude of visual map research in regards to Afghanistan.[^24] The origins of this research revolve around Afghanistan’s Highway One, or A01. This highway is the world’s longest looped, consecutive ring road[^25], while more than two-thirds of the country’s population live within 30 miles of it.[^26] An invisible piece of infrastructure, the potential to create a national and cultural unity and identity, the ملى قطار Millie Rail is now superimposed on this existing network, connecting the most major cities, along with smaller towns and villages along the way. Offshoots exist in areas where populations exist a great scale outside the loop, while an inner loop may be executed during further research.\n\n![ملى قطار Millie Rail map](../../../images/work/millie/default-map-2.jpg)\n\n\nThe loop, coincidentally and conveniently, borrows from the circular visual language existing in the original ملى بس Millie Bus logo. These semi and quarter circle shapes create a consistent relationship between the graphic identity, all centered around the constant idea of a “ring” connecting *all* of Afghanistan together.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe outcome I have presented is only a fraction of the work and research I have conducted in regards to the topic of Afghanistan and its lack of rail. It has been an extremely beautiful research process that I hope does not come to an end, however sources and citations on this topic are limited, as is with many topics regarding design, architecture, and communication technologies in Afghanistan; the purpose of this work is to finally change that and develop new work that can be traced, documented, and referenced in the future. For these reasons, in my work I approach Afghan design through a speculative lens, imagining pasts and futures through the small lens of Afghan culture that I posses.\n\nWith the research and work contained in this paper, I myself am now at the point of “so what?”. When I imagine ideal next steps, I hope to share this work in order to generate and kickstart the imagination of young Afghan students and thinkers to see how design can influence new ways of thinking about our country. I am hoping to push the design output to consist of urban poster mockups, architectural renders of train stations, and even the inside of an “Afghan car train” where people sit on the floor against Afghan rugs and pillows as they do in their homes. Pushing the boundaries of design through theoretical new media approaches is a space I see this work addressing, and hopefully inspiring more to do the same.\n\n![Sketches for logo](../../../images/work/millie/sketches_1.jpg)\n\n![Sketches for map](../../../images/work/millie/sketches_2.jpg)\n\nI by no means see this paper as being “done”, but as a device to kickstart the next chapter of work through dialogue and discourse, unlocking more historical research that will enable myself and other Afghan designers to develop a firm base to keep adding to. Perhaps one day all Afghans will come together to ride the ملى قطار Millie Rail from the north to the south, and from the east to the west of our beautiful homeland. \n\n**Omar Mohammad\\\nBerkeley, December 2024** \n\n---\n` `\n[^1]: See projects: https://omarmhmmd.com/\n[^2]: Senj: Afghan Wood Framing Technology https://eartharchitecture.org/?p=1887\n[^3]: For example, Kabul University, the premier university of Afghanistan, began an Architecture program in 1967.

The mosque acts not only as a spiritual place of prayer, but as an important space for the community to grow together, as a beacon of the existence of Islam in reference to the culture of a particular region, and as a space for Muslims to share, create, and grow identity. The architectural identity of mosques around the world, however, differs based on its regional, societal, and cultural factors. A mosque in Morocco looks vastly different than a mosque in Saudi Arabia based upon factors of environmental landscape, climate, and both esoteric and exoteric culture. The architecture of a mosque “plays a role in defining, articulating and improving society's perception of itself…” [^1]. Muslims in these countries culturally identify with their holy places of worship, which in turn gives them a sense of trust, belonging, and inheritance to the space and society they occupy. Granted, Islam in Morocco and Saudi Arabia dates its origin 1400 years ago. These countries, as with other eastern Islamic countries such as Turkey, Afghanistan, and Indonesia, have been able to develop a culture over time based solely and dominantly on the principles of Islam. Thus, they were able to mirror their culture into the architecture of their mosques. Conversely, as Islam began to make its way West, and as the West began to make its way to Islam, Islamic cultural identity slowly began to lose its grasp on the mosque.[^2]\n\n![Figure 0. A speculative sketch of Capitol Hill converted into a mosque, Omar Mohammad, 2020](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/0.png)\n\n### Identity\nThe Islamic identity of America is an eclectic one constantly overpowered by which race or ethnic group holds ownership of the most important cultural space for a Muslim to share, create, and grow identity: the mosque. Not only that, but the architectural form of mosques in America today takes the form of old churches, business parks, or even homes. Built anew, the more grandiose “real” mosques are reflections of the culture and identity of Islamic regions in the east; back home. It is rare to find a mosque in America that holds true American identity. Through the research of cultural Islamic architecture and its comparison to the eclecticism and search for an early American architectural identity, I will attempt to convey why the mosque in America has yet to build architectural roots apropos to its American identity, and how this lack of identity affects the identity of the Muslim American community as a whole.\n\n![Figure 1. (left) US Muslim population growth, Pew Research, (right) The American Mosque 2020: Growing and Evolving, Institute for Social Policy and Understanding](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/1.png) \n\nToday there are roughly 3.45 million Muslims living in America [^3] [fig. 1]. This statistic consists of an amalgamation of different ethnic, racial, and cultural groups, ranging primarily from South East Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African nations. The Islamic identity of America is an extremely eclectic one, yet this sense of cosmopolitanism cannot be found in the design and architecture of American mosques, let alone in the identity of individual American Muslims. In his paper titled Islam and the Cultural Imperative, American convert Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah addresses this very issue that Muslims in America face. By remaining attached to the lands and cultures they left behind, Muslim immigrants are developing sub-cultures that revolve and only thrive within Islamic schools, college campuses, homes, and especially the mosque [^4]. These sub-cultures reflect a counter-cultural approach to what it means to be American, causing American Muslims to live dual-lives: one at the mosque and at home, one in the outside world.\n\nA typical administration structure for a mosque in America is determined by the ethnic or racial group that holds ownership of the property. The culture of these groups are then used as the foundations for who should be in charge, what should be taught, and what languages to speak. Dr. Abd-Allah states that, “Managing the mosque sub-culture is the biggest challenge, since it has already become ‘second nature’ for a vocal minority and difficult to reorient, despite the fact that it alienates a substantial part of the community.” Abd-Allah’s solution to this issue can be prescribed through the means of the architecture of the mosque: “A successful Muslim American culture would produce mosques which – like those of the traditional Islamic world – express fully the universal idea of the mosque in consonance with Islamic transcendental norms while creating American sacred space in harmony with an indigenous ethos and normative aesthetic sense.” Abd-Allah wants Mosques in America to look and feel American, just as the mosques in Morocco and Saudi Arabia look and feel Moroccan and Arab.\n\nOne of the first problems pertaining to the lack of a sound American mosque can be traced to the origins of Islamic Art and Architecture and the theories formed by western “orientalists” regarding it. According to Professor Nasser Rabat, the study of the architecture of the Islamic world was a post-Enlightenment European project. The term “Islamic Architecture” was never coined nor created by Muslims themselves. After toying with terms like “Mohammaden”, “Saracenic” or “Oriental”, “Islamic Architecture” was deemed fit and with it all Islamic art from varying cultures, regions, people, and countries (about 50) was homogenized into a single term and study [^5]. By the 18th and 19th century, colonial powers, globalization, and western powers deemed Islamic Architecture to be a tradition of the past; a novelty that would not be taught in the schools. With this lack of an in depth education to the design and architecture of the eastern world within the architectural schools of the early 19th century, how can one blame the west for being unable to devise and design its own architectural form for a mosque? There was no blue print of avant-garde studies for Islamic architecture like those from the early 20th century German Bauhaus, or the constructivist Russians which both had a say in the development of the modern architecture of America. This pedagogy of pushing architecture from the traditional to the modern as it did in the western world never existed for Islamic architecture in America.\n\n### Colonial Religious Identity\nThis search for an Islamic American architectural identity is extremely difficult to navigate within a landscape that has already been defined by an American (colonial) architectural history of almost 300 years. However, the search for a religious identity in America does not start with the Muslims; it began with the search for an original identity by the colonizing pilgrims of England. The pilgrims consisted of the Puritan and the Anglican church, each defined by their own personal beliefs, values, and ways of life. The easiest and most critical way to differ these two churches from one another was through their architecture. The Puritans believed in a purer way of religion, where the hierarchy to God was unnecessary: everyone could speak to and possess a relationship with God. They did not believe in the ornamentation of their places of worship, and disliked the need for music and celebration to praise their Lord. The Puritan church was simple, lacked ornamentation, and painted in dull, white colors [^6] [fig. 2.1]. The Anglican church was highly decorative with intricate facades and stained glass windows, using interior design and space as a means to praise and prayer [^7] [fig. 2.2]. These colonizers were (problematically) able to create a new identity and start up their colonies right off the boat through the design and construction of their places of worship.\n\n![Figure 2.1. Puritan Church, Old Ship Church, Hingham, Massachusetts, (Timothy Valentine)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/2.1.png) \n\n![Figure 2.2. Anglican Church, Newport Parish Church, Smithfield, Virginia, (Carol M. Highsmith Kallicrates via Wikimedia Commons)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/2.2.png) \n\nThis search for a bespoke architectural identity did not end with the church, however. As the population of the early United States began to increase, the need for an independent identity void of the culture in England became imminent. The structure of the Greek democratic government was used as a guiding force towards developing the government and the constitution of the United States of America. Adopting the classical methods towards the creation of a nation, neo-classical architecture was deemed the most appropriate fit for the newly developed country. Apses, domes, and columns were present not only in the buildings of DC, but also in those of plantations in the South. As time continued to pass, an eclectic approach of architecture was applied to the US, until the first skyscraper was born and a true American architecture was defined through modernism.\n\nWhile Islam in America continued to grow, the architecture of the west continued without the influence of Islamic architecture, or much eastern architecture at all. When mosques were built from the ground up without much contextual inspiration, they looked liked one-off low-resolution copies of grand and majestic mosques “back home”. That said, the lack of funding for early muslim communities also forced mosques to take the form and shape of any place that would let them: old churches, businesses, or even homes. This eclecticism of not only form but function of mosque space leaves the everyday American with no clear image of what Islam truly looks like in America. With the lack of a strong aesthetic sense of the single most important place of worship, how could an Islamic identity thrive in America? Just as America defined its identity through time with its skyscraper cities, sprawling highways, and national parks, so too can it define an Islamic identity of its own.\n\n\n### East Bay Area Mosques\n\n\u003Ciframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1mJmUGAyPBfSYRl4t7aglejpDfDg6bF4&ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"auto\" height=\"480\">\u003C/iframe>\n` `\n\nIt is important now to present multiple cases that demonstrate this lack of a defined identity of mosque architecture in America. Focusing on the East Bay Area of California between the borders of the Contra Costa County district, there exists five mosques within a ~25 mile radius of one another [fig. 3]:\n\n1 - Islamic Center of Contra Costa (ICC) – Concord\n\\\n2 - Noor Islamic Center of Concord (NICC) – Concord\n\\\n3 - Walnut Creek Islamic Center (WCIC) – Walnut Creek\n\\\n4 - San Ramon Valley Islamic Center (SRVIC) – San Ramon\n\\\n5 - Muslim Community Center (MCC) – Pleasanton (Outside of Contra Costa County but neighboring San Ramon)\n\nOf these five mosques, only ICC was built from the ground up [fig. 4.2], yet it appears solely as a commercial rectangular box with green (the color of Islam) trimmings and Arabic above its sign. NICC has been newly housed within an old church; previously it belonged to a small room located above a smoke shop turned cowboy boot shop in a latino neighborhood [fig. 4.1]. WCIC was previously housed in a room located in a 7/11 and Starbucks parking lot. It is now housed within an old church located on a street where 3 other churches exist; one literally right across the street and one a block over.\n\n![Figure 4.1. Previous location of NICC on the second floor of a retail building, Concord, California (Loopnet)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/4.1.png) \n\n![Figure 4.2. Islamic Center of Contra Costa, Concord, California, (icofcc.com)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/4.2.png) \n\n![Figure 4.3. San Ramon Valley Islamic Center, San Ramon, California, (Jennifer Wadsworth, Patch Staff)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/4.3.png) \n\n![Figure 4.4. Muslim Community Center East Bay, Pleasanton, California, (Guidestar)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/4.4.png) \n\nSRVIC [fig. 4.3] and MCC [fig. 4.4] are housed within business parks where neighboring buildings are occupied by a Kung Fu school, a real estate company, and offsets of Hewlett Packard and the Boeing Company. All of these mosques utilize fluorescent lighting one may find in a hospital or corporate office. Parking is awful at all of these institutions; so bad that security and parking personnel are required so that adherents of the mosque don’t get parking tickets.\n\nNone of these places were easy to obtain, cheap to maintain, or even affordable for the community. The Islamic community itself mutually funds these spaces. During the month of Ramadan, an excessive amount of charity is given in grand amounts to pay for the costs and expenses that it takes to run these spaces; these include rent, mortgage, electric and water bills, cleaning fees, and a salary for the resident imam. It is not only during Ramadan that money is donated; the community is urged to pitch in after most Friday prayers, and multiple fundraisers are held and organized throughout the year. NICC, WCIC, and SRVIC have currently stated on the homepage of their websites that they are in need of funding (2018). SRVIC is in need of $100,000 by the end of 2018. One might suggest that if all of these mosques were to agree to work together, they would indefinitely be able to finally afford and build the kind of mosques that one would find in Muslim countries. A location could be picked at the midpoint of their current locations. Would not a grand mosque that reflects the cultural values and ideals of Islam in America make it worth the extra ten-minute drive?\n\n### West Africa & Afghanistan\nIn Deconstructing the American Mosque, Kahera addressed issues regarding the spatial location of mosques. In order to satisfy the requirements of having congregational spaces to pray particularly close to certain communities, the Dyula Muslims of West Africa devised three types of Mosques [^8]:\n\n1 - The Seritongo; used by individuals or small groups for daily prayers.\n\\\n2 - The Misijidi; used by families from local communities for daily prayers and Friday prayers if there is no access to a Friday mosque.\n\\\n3 - The Jamiu; used for Friday prayers and serves the requirements for the entire Muslim community as a whole.\n\\\n4 - The Seritongo was stated to be as a place literally demarcated by stones and sand in the ground. The Jamiu is then the grand mosque of the community that looks and feels like a Dyula mosque [fig. 5].\n\n![Figure 5. The Grand Mosque of Bobo-Dioulasso, Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, (Courtesy qiv)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/5.png) \n\nOn this notion of different “levels” in mosque design, I inquired my grandmother, 78 year old Sharifa Simab on her time growing up and living in Kabul, Afghanistan before fleeing the Soviet Invasion in 1985 [^9]. During our interview, I asked her about the location of mosques in relation to her home, and how distance from and to these mosques played its role on their locations. What she told me was an indirect reference to the Dyula mosques: there were small mosques throughout the neighborhood that one could walk to for daily prayers or as a small communal meeting place, but it was rare for the community to pray Friday prayers or celebrate religious holidays at these spaces. For that, one would make the longer hour walk or short bus ride and visit the grand mosques of Kabul. The multi-cultural communities in America are spending too many resources on smaller lack-luster spaces of worship versus coming together as a community and devising mosque plans such as the Dyula or Afghan people were able to design. This issue, however, is correlated back to the lack of cultural diversity within mosques that Dr. Abd-Allah makes reference to. Each mosque is sometimes governed by a certain culture; a speculative factor for the need of five main East Bay Area mosques within a 25 mile radius is a form of national and cultural pride that has stepped in the way of creating one central, multicultural, and cosmopolitan mosque. The Arabs go to the mosque in Walnut Creek, the Afghans go to the mosques in Concord, and the Pakistanis go to the mosques in San Ramon and Pleasanton. These sub-cultures are able to thrive in these settings, while disregarding their American identities and the American nuance of diversity.\n\n### The Speculative Mosque\nThe speculative design of the Park51 mosque in New York [fig. 6.1 & 6.2] proposed in 2010, dubbed as the “Ground Zero Mosque” by anti-Islamic organizations, is a prime example of the not so progressive path that American mosques might have to take in order to be realized. Located a couple blocks from the Ground Zero memorial, the project was originally titled “Cordoba House”. Known for its religious and cultural diversity, Cordoba was the third capital of the Ummayyad Caliphate in Spain of 756 – 1031.\n\n![Figure 6.1. Park51 interior, New York City, New York, (SOMA)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/6.1.png) \n\n![Figure 6.2. Park51 facade, New York City, New York, (SOMA)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/6.2.png) \n\nIn an interview conducted by The Architecture Foundation during a symposium titled Faith in the City, the architect of the Park51 project Michel Abboud, a Lebanese Christian himself, constantly defines the space as a multi-level mixed use community center and not a mosque [^8]. The mosque or the prayer hall of the project has been placed out of sight in the basement. During this interview, a Muslim audience member questioned this motive and called it a “failure” that represents Islam in an apologetic form. From the name change, to its definition as a community center, and to the prayer hall being placed in the basement, all of these signs point to an America that wants nothing to do with a mosque as grand, elegant, and beautiful as the Hassan II Mosque in Morocco or the Blue Mosque in Turkey [fig. 7 & 8].\n\n![Figure 7. Grande Mosquée Hassan II, Casablanca, Morocco, (Courtesy Creative Commons CC0 1.0)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/7.png) \n\n![Figure 8. Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmed Mosque), Istanbul, Turkey, (Courtesy Nseranno), Wikimedia Commons](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/8.png) \n\nPark51 points signs to a post 9/11 America where Islamic architecture has to be apologetic in order to thrive. It is important to notice the names of this mosque and the previous five east bay mosques I discussed. There is no “mosque” or masjid in any of their titles. Across the United States, many mosques have been built under the guise of the “Islamic Center” ever since the first mosque to be built in the capital city of America was named the Islamic Center of Washington. Out of the scope of this essay, I would have loved to conduct further research on the correlation between the names and the architecture of these mosques. Does naming the mosque a “center” change the approach to its design? If it’s named by “mosque” will its design adhere to more Islamic architectural principles?\n\n### American Mosques\nBefore 9/11, however, two mosques in metropolitan regions in America were built and designed in a manner that I believe is true to both Islamic and American identity: the Islamic Center of Washington DC 1954 [fig. 9] and the Islamic Cultural Center of New York 1991 [fig. 10].\n\n![Figure 9. Islamic Center of Washington DC, Washington DC, (Courtesy Carol M. Highsmith [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/9.png) \n\n![Figure 10. Islamic Cultural Center of New York, New York, (Jim.henderson)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/10.png) \n\nBoth of these mosques are representative of the landscape they are situated in. ICWDC looks like the White House and buildings on Capitol Hill had a love child with Mamluk style mosques of Egypt: it is truly successful in holding on to traditional elements while coupling them with American ones. The ICCNY, designed by renowned modernist architectural firm SOM, takes hints from a postmodern Frank Lloyd Wright design language and merges them with a traditional dome and minaret pairing. These two mosques, along with the red bricked geometric form of the Islamic Society of North America 1982 [fig. 11] in Plainfield, Indiana are three mosques that look like they belong in America and nowhere else.\n\n![Figure 11. Islamic Society of North America, Plainfield, Indiana, (Omar Khalidi)](../../../images/work/theamericanmosque/11.png) \n\nOne could not pick up one of these mosques and place them in Afghanistan, Egypt, or Indonesia; these mosques don’t possess a known style, and that is exactly what makes them American.\n\nDue to the limits of this essay I am unable to propose an architectural solution to all of these points. What I am hoping to have succeeded in is to give you, the reader, a glimpse into the issues of identity that American Muslims face in regards to the lack of a strong visual, spiritual, and religious relationship with an architectural identity apropos to an American Mosque. A misconception of Islamic Architecture that dates to the 18th century, a lack of unity in diversity among different Islamic cultures in America, a burgeoning dependence on efficient and affordable eclectic spaces, and an apologetic post 9/11 landscape are only some of the causes for the lack of a sound architectural identity pertaining to the American Mosque.

The\nhorizontal poles are around 15-20cm in diameter, and the vertical/diagonal poles around 10-15cm.[^1] They are joined by mortise\nand tenon about 1m apart, where they are then lifted and filled with sun-dried bricks, placed at a diagonal relationship between\nthe vertical and diagonal poles.\n\n![Sourcing poplar poles, from \"Poplars in Afghanistan\" by May, Silvio, \"Unasylva, Vol. 31 No. 124 1979\"](../../../images/work/senj/poplar.jpg)\n\nIn the photo above, we see a group of men sourcing poles from a poplar stand.[^2] The poplar species commonly used in\nAfghanistan is the *populas alba*, or white poplar, سفيدار (safaidaar). The poles are commonly referred to as دستك (destak), a\nbeam, round in cross section.[^3]\n\n![Drawing showing سنج Senj build with foundation and roofing, from \"Afghanistan: An Atlas of Indigenous Domestic Architecture\" p.153](../../../images/work/senj/4.jpg)\n\nThe infilled brick frames are then plastered with a mud and straw mixture on both the interior and the exterior facades. Itseems that over time, however, the diagonal poles have been integrated into the complete frame, plastered over and completely hidden. Notice this drawing:\n\n![Drawing showing the exposed poplar diagonal pole, from \"Traditional Architecture of Afghanistan\" p.187](../../../images/work/senj/5.jpg \"Drawing showing the exposed poplar diagonal pole, from the book Afghanistan: An Atlas of Indigenous Domestic Architecture p.153.\")\n\nThe diagonal bracing pole is left exposed outside of the plaster, as seen in these photos:\n\n![\"Vernacular Housing of Kabul\", 2006. https://www.archnet.org/sites/5610](../../../images/work/senj/6.jpg \"Vernacular Housing of Kabul, 2006, https://www.archnet.org/sites/5610\")\n\n![\"Vernacular Housing of Kabul\", 2006. https://www.archnet.org/sites/5610](../../../images/work/senj/7.jpg \"Vernacular Housing of Kabul, 2006, https://www.archnet.org/sites/5610\")\n\n![\"Amin House Restoration\", Kabul, Afghanistan 2004-2005. https://www.archnet.org/sites/5585](../../../images/work/senj/8.jpg)\n\nHere on the left side wall, all poles have been plastered over and no remnants of the structure are exposed. Could the strength have increased by having the diagonals be integrated into the frame, rather than existing on the exterior of it?\n\nIn *Afghanistan: An Atlas of Indigenous Domestic Architecture*, the authors state that diagonal poles are *nailed* at the exterior corners to stabilize the frame, not integrated within the frame itself. It is beautiful to witness the underlying structure with the poplar poles exposed as such in the older buildings, and saddening to see that design decision disappear over time. Even more so it is a shame the patterning that the bricks create are also plastered over and disappear. We wonder how senj technology can be re-contextualized contemporarily to become a textural, aesthetic, modular device while also supplying firm, structural integrity to a design.\n\n### Model\n\n![Model Drawing](../../../images/work/senj/9.jpg)\n\n![Scale studies](../../../images/work/senj/10.jpg)\n\nThe سنج Senj model is constructed with pine dowels, a poplar base, and sun dried bricks.

Earth and wood come together as literal Earthen materials to define a hybrid material culture; whereas the Earth gave structure and support to the growing roots of the Poplar, the Poplar now returns the favor and provides a framework for the Earth.\n\n![Senj: Afghan Wood Framing Technology. 1’/1.5” scale.
